# Mingle

This is a dating application that is fully built with Jetpack compose. `NOTE:` the application is still under very heavy development and your contrubutions are welcome. Chekout the [issues]() section and help work some of the pending issues, enhancements and bugs. Feel free to also add any issues or bugs detected.

<a href='https://bit.ly/3ZXANcg'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src="./screenshots/google_badge.png" width="150"/></a>

## **Instructions‚ÜóÔ∏è**
To run the application you download the version present on [Playstore](https://bit.ly/3ZXANcg) or clone this project into your machine. Once you clone you'll need to connect the project to firebase and add the `google-services.json` file to this path:

```gradle
app\
    src\ 
       dev
```
`NOTE`
 To simulate the real feel of the application you'll have to create two or three accounts and select different genders and interests in the account creation process. To make this entire process easier you can use this [`google-services.json`](http://bit.ly/3ZCbtI4) that already has test users that i am using for development phase. 


I am using product flavours and have three flavours `dev` , `staging` and `production`. Once you have added the `google-services.json` file to the dev flavour variant path,
   * You have to check and confirm that you have selected the `devDebug` Build variant. To do this:
     * navigate to bottom left side of your android studio and select `Build Variants`
     * Under the :app level module select `devDebug`
     * Once gradle build is done Run the application
 
   `NOTE` You will also need to add this to your `local.properties` file. 
  
  ```gradle
  
  MAPS_API_KEY = API_KEY_HERE
  ADMOB_APP_ID = APP_ID_HERE
  BANNER_ADD_ID = "BANNER_ID_HERE"
  
  ```
     
## Contribution ü™∂
To contribute to the project clone it and make your changes. Once done with making changes, on the terminal of your android studio run
   1. * ` ./gradlew spotlessApply `
   2.  * `./gradlew ktlintFormat `
   3. * `./gradlew ktlintcheck `
 
  Once the code passes all ktlint checks push the code and open a `Pull Request`

 ## Architecture üèöÔ∏è
The application is built following a multi module approach with all features being developed as separate modules. We have the Network Module which contains the data and domain layers for alll the features and each feature contains its own presentation (ui layer).

### 1.UI layer
The role of the UI layer (or presentation layer) is to display the application data on the screen. Whenever the data changes, either due to user interaction (such as pressing a button) or external input (such as a network response), the UI should update to reflect the changes.
The UI layer is made up of two things:

* UI elements that render the data on the screen. You build these elements using Views or Jetpack Compose functions.
* State holders (such as ViewModel classes) that hold data, expose it to the UI, and handle logic.

### 2.Data layer
The data layer of an app contains the business logic. The business logic is what gives value to your app‚Äîit's made of rules that determine how your app creates, stores, and changes data.
The data layer is made of repositories that each can contain zero to many data sources. You should create a repository class for each different type of data you handle in your app.

### 3.Domain Layer
The domain layer is an optional layer that sits between the UI and data layers.
The domain layer is responsible for encapsulating complex business logic, or simple business logic that is reused by multiple ViewModels. This layer is optional because not all apps will have these requirements. You should use it only when needed‚Äîfor example, to handle complexity or favor reusability
